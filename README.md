# Fractal_Animator
 A GUI project that uses two panels. One of them is used for displaying a fractal and the other contains settings for the fractal.
 There are three fractals from which the user can select one to be generated. The first fractal is the Pythegorian Tree. This fractal has settings such as angle of the fractal, number of iterations and color of the fractal and background.
 The other fractals are the Mandelbrot set Fractal and the Phoenix set Fractal. As settings they have a complexity scale which adds layers of color to the fractal.
 The program can also save and load settings.
